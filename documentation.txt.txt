Documentation for the work

For cloning the remote, the git clone link command was used. After creating a repo on github, the command git remote --v was used to list current origins. After that git remote rm origin was used to remove the current origin and git remote add origin link was used to add a new one.

For adding files with a commit, git add . or git add filename was used and after that git commit -m "initial commit" was used.

To create a new branch, git branch branchname was used, then git checkout branchname.

At the end, git checkout master, git rebase branchname was used. We could use merge instead of rebase but that would leave an extra commit message on the branch.

There were no conflicts for the merge because the branch was up to date with master because we created the branch through master.
